              My Name is Habiba Ashraf and I am a creative problem solver with 
              a passion for technology and innovation. With a background in 
              Google Ads/ Google Adwords SEO and graphic designing,
   

               I'm now excited to pivot into the field of AI development, where I can 

combine my skills with my fascination 
                 for artificial intelligence. <br/>
  

               
                 And now, I feel like I've 
                 reached a point 

where I can acquire all this knowledge and skills, In Shaa Allah.<br/>
                 

<br/>
              
                I have the privilege of learning these skills under 

the guidance of Sir Asif, 
                who is an excellent teacher. He allows us to 

freely discuss any study-related 
                topics and provides friendly 

guidance.<br/><br/>

                I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Head of this project  

and their team members who thought of 
                introducing an AI course in Rahim Yar Khan for 

the benefit of the local community.
                Thank you so much, Sir! We believe that 

with teachers like you by our side, we 
                will definitely achieve our goals, 

In Shaa Allah, and make a mark in the world of
                 AI.
<br/><br/>
               

 Thanks a lot, Sir!"
